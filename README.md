## Hello, this is the repository for module 20 credit risk classification.

In the folder 'Credit_Risk' you will find:

 - '**credit_risk_classification.ipynb**' - contains two logistic regression models to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

  - '**report.md**' - a write up of the analysis.

Thanks
